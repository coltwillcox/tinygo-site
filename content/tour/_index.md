Welcome to the tour of TinyGo!

This tour assumes you're already familiar with Go. If not, you can go through the [tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/) to get started.

Every example in this tour is runnable directly in the browser, and most can be downloaded directly to your own electronics board (like the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333)).
