This short tour will get you up to speed with blinking a simple LED. This is a great way to start, especially if you've never done electronics before: if the LED blinks you know that everything works to continue in the tour. If you can't get it to work, you might need to do some troubleshooting before you can continue.

This tour also teaches the basics of the TinyGo-specific machine package.
